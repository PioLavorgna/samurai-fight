## 🌎 Project 🏯
Hello, I'd like to introduce you to my personal project: 
a vintage game where two samurai engage in battles, 
developed entirely using pure JavaScript. 
This game represents an example of my work in the field of web development and programming. 
I created it as a personal challenge to demonstrate the versatility and power of JavaScript in crafting engaging entertainment applications. 
The technical foundation of this project focuses on clean code, 
resource optimization, and the use of HTML5 and CSS to ensure a smooth and authentic user experience. 
It's a concrete example of what can be achieved with web development skills and JavaScript.
