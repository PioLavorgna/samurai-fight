## üåé Project
With this project, you can manage the random selection of a list of names for various purposes, 
such as deciding who speaks first in a discussion or any other situation where randomness is required. 
Just provide the list of names, and the page will take care of the rest.

## üé≤ Random-peolple üê≥ Win White Wale

The birth of this solution is a story of inspiration and growth. 
Originally developed to facilitate discussions during business meetings, 
it had an extraordinary impact on the colleagues I worked with. 
It opened the doors to anyone, regardless of their initial experience, 
allowing them to speak, discuss, and gradually overcome shyness and their own limitations.

This idea didn't spring solely from a passion for computer science, 
but also from nature itself. 
It's a tribute to the beauty and strength of the white whales, 
majestic creatures symbolizing the hidden power within each of us. 
The story of these white whales has provided inspiration 
to convey a powerful message to those who were initially inexperienced: their potential is as vast as the ocean.
